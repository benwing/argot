* Addressed [Issue #1][]:

  1. In the usage display, options are now sorted so that the POSIX-style
     single-character option names always precede any longer GNU-style
     synonyms.
  2. The `Argot` constructor now supports an `sortOptions` parameter, which
     defaults to `true`. If set to `true`, the options in the usage output
     are sorted lexically. If set to `false`, the options are displayed in
     the order they were specified in the code.

Upgraded [Grizzled Scala][] dependency to version 1.0.3.
* Now compiles against [Scala][] 2.8.1, as well as 2.8.0.
