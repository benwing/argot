* Renamed to *clap* (**C**ommand **L**ine **A**rgument **P**arser)

* Addressed [Issue #1][]:

  1. In the usage display, options are now sorted so that the POSIX-style
     single-character option names always precede any longer GNU-style
     synonyms.
  2. The `Argot` constructor now supports an `sortOptions` parameter, which
     defaults to `true`. If set to `true`, the options in the usage output
     are sorted lexically. If set to `false`, the options are displayed in
     the order they were specified in the code.
