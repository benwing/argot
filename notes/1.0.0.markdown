* Built for the Scala 2.10.0 series _only_ (2.10.0-RC1 and -RC3, initially).
* Added `-feature` to `scalac` options, and removed all feature warnings.
* Upgraded build to SBT 0.12.

**This version, and later versions, are 2.10-only.** 2.9.x and earlier will be
supported via the `pre-scala-2.10` GitHub branch. This is due to changes
in the Scala library between 2.9 and 2.10.
